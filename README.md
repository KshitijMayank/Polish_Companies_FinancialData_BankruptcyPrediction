# Polish_Companies_FinancialData_BankruptcyPrediction
### ABOUT THE PROJECT

### *December20-January21*

## Introduction
Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy and various measures of financial distress of firms. The prediction of bankruptcy in companies is a problem that has concerned entrepreneurs, researchers and even governments for years, since detecting early signs that a company is going to enter bankruptcy involuntarily and being able to save it from that process, can help reduce the economic losses that bankruptcy entails, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. A business condition of either a small or large firm concerns local community, industry participants and investors, but also influences policy makers and the global economy and we aim to tackle this problem by developing a predictive model that combines various econometric parameters which allow foreseeing the financial condition of a firm.

## Dataset
We have chosen the Polish bankruptcy data, hosted by the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. The data was col- lected from Bankruptcy Prediction: Mining the Polish Bankruptcy Data Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evalu- ated from 2007 to 2013. The dataset is very apt for our research about bankruptcy prediction because it has highly useful econometric indicators as attributes (features) and comes with a huge number of samples of Polish companies that were analyzed in 5 different time-frames: Based on the collected data five classification cases were distinguished, that depends on the forecasting period:
- 1. 1st year: The data contains financial rates from 1st year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 5 years.
- 2. 2nd year: The data contains financial rates from 2nd year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 4 years.
- 3. 3rd year: The data contains financial rates from 3rd year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 3 years.
- 4. 4th year: The data contains financial rates from 4th year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 2 years.
- 5. 5th year: The data contains financial rates from 5th year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 1 years.


 ## Methodologies
In this project we plan to utilize Supervised Machine Learning techniques to reach our goals. The tentative project plan could be segregated into the following steps:
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): To analyze patterns within the data,extract dependencies, compare correlations, identify missing values and recognize imbalances if any and use suitable tech- niques like mean Imputation,k-nearest neighbors imputation,undersampling, SMOTE analysis, etc. to tackle them.
- Training Models: We will train various classification techniques on our data to achieve the task of completing our objective of predicting bankruptcy of a given company. The techniques which we plan to implement are:
- 1. Gaussian Na ̈ıve Bayes
- 2. Logistic Regression
- 3. Support Vector Machines 
- 4. Artificial Neural Networks
